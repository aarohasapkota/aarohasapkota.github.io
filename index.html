        <h2>📌 Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This is a full chess game built in Java. It supports local multiplayer, online games with friends,
            and an AI opponent using the Stockfish engine. The app follows MVC, has a JavaFX GUI, and uses
            Firebase for user accounts, profiles, and a friends system with real-time updates.
        </p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The goal was to build a full object-oriented chess application from scratch, practice design
                patterns, and connect a real chess engine and online features. It's meant to feel like a complete
                chess app, not just a small school demo.

            <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Java (game logic + backend)</li>
                <li>JavaFX (GUI with board and screens)</li>
                <li>Firebase (auth + real-time data for users and friends)</li>
                <li>Stockfish Chess Engine (AI opponent)</li>

            <h3>Design & Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                The project uses a clear model layer for pieces, board, and game state. FEN notation is used
                for board serialization. The code follows MVC and uses several design patterns:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decorator</strong> – chain move validation checks</li>
                <li><strong>Observer</strong> – update UI and other parts when the game state changes</li>
                <li><strong>Template Method</strong> – support different game modes (local, online, vs AI)</li>
                <li><strong>Adapter</strong> – connect to the Stockfish engine</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Testing & Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                I wrote JUnit tests for core game logic like piece movement, coordinates, and move validation.
                I also generated JavaDoc (100+ HTML pages) for all major classes and methods.

        <h2>✨ Main Features</h2>

        <div class="features-grid">

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>♟ Full Chess Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Supports all normal chess moves, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
                    Uses FEN notation to save and restore board positions.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>🎮 Local & Online Games</h3>
                <p>
                    Play locally on the same machine or online with friends. Different game modes are handled
                    using a shared base flow (Template Method pattern).
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>🤖 Play vs AI</h3>
                <p>
                    Play against the Stockfish chess engine. The Adapter pattern is used to connect my Java
                    code to the engine.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>🔐 User Accounts & Friends</h3>
                <p>
                    Firebase handles login, signup, and user profiles. There is a friends system with requests,
                    friend lists, and real-time updates.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>📜 Move History & Stats</h3>
                <p>
                    Tracks move history, game results, timers, and basic player stats. Makes it easy to see
                    what happened in past games.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-card">
                <h3>💾 Save & Load Games</h3>
                <p>
                    A separate persistence layer handles saving and loading games and user-related data so
                    it doesn't mix with the game logic or UI code.
                </p>
